Case Study – Eniac’s Discount Strategy (Completed)

Objective: Settled the internal debate at Eniac by analyzing the true impact of discounts on revenue, customer behavior, and long-term profitability using raw, messy transaction data.
Project Goal: Quantified whether discounting drives sustainable growth or erodes margins—delivering data-backed clarity to Marketing and the Board.
Key Achievements:
Cleaned and merged 6 chaotic internal datasets: orders, order items, products, customers, payments, and promotions.
Defined discount cohorts (0%, 1–10%, 11–25%, 26%+) and tracked LTV, repeat rate, AOV, and margin per cohort.
Revealed: 11–25% discounts boosted acquisition +38% and repeat rate +22%, with LTV up 19%—while >25% discounts tanked margin −41% with no LTV gain.
Built Python dashboards (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) showing discount sweet spot: 15% average maximizes profit per customer.

Focus: Real-world business analytics with Python—turning internal chaos into strategic insight.
